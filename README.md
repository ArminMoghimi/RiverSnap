# RiverSnap - estimation of river hydrological parameters

## Overviwe
RiverSnap is a local citizen science project that records and estimates some hydrological parameters such as water level (water level), river course (erosion/subsidence of the river), and vegetation.

The project pursues two interlinked objectives. On the one hand, this project aims to provide a simple and suitable platform for scientists like the coastSnap platform (https://github.com/Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network) for community members and people who use their smartphones to take pictures/videos of a river from a fixed location and share the images with us via social media. On the other hand, this project aims to develop and implement robust, intelligent, cost-effective, and efficient artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches for extracting hydrological parameters/features of rivers from these images/videos.




The first paper was published in IEEE Access (codes and dataset):

## Our paper presents the Python code for fine-tuning [SAM](https://segment-anything.com/) for water segmentation from close-range remote sensing images, which is under development.

This code is developed based on the original code of SAM (https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) and a nice tutorial presented by Alexandre Bonnet regarding fine-tuning of SAM available at https://encord.com/blog/learn-how-to-fine-tune-the-segment-anything-model-sam/
