## Overviwe
RiverSnap is a local citizen science project that records and estimates some hydrological parameters such as water level (water level), river course (erosion/subsidence of the river), and vegetation.

The project pursues two interlinked objectives. On the one hand, this project aims to provide a simple and suitable platform for scientists, community members, and people who use their smartphones to take pictures/videos of a river from a fixed location and share the images with us via social media. On the other hand, this project aims to develop and implement robust, intelligent, cost-effective, and efficient artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches for extracting hydrological parameters/features of rivers from these images/videos.
